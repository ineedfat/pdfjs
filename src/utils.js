    "For text strings encoded in Unicode, the first two bytes must be 254 followed by
    255, representing the Unicode byte order marker, U+FEFF. (This sequence conflicts
    with the PDFDocEncoding character sequence thorn ydieresis, which is unlikely
    to be a meaningful beginning of a word or phrase.) The remainder of the
    string consists of Unicode character codes, according to the UTF-16 encoding
    specified in the Unicode standard, version 2.0. Commonly used Unicode values
    are represented as 2 bytes per character, with the high-order byte appearing first
    in the string."

    In other words, if there are chars in a string with char code above 255, we
    recode the string to UCS2 BE - string doubles in length and BOM is prepended.

    HOWEVER!
    Actual *content* (body) text (as opposed to strings used in document properties etc)
    does NOT expect BOM. There, it is treated as a literal GID (Glyph ID)

    Because of Adobe's focus on "you subset your fonts!" you are not supposed to have
    a font that maps directly Unicode (UCS2 / UTF16BE) code to font GID, but you could
    fudge it with "Identity-H" encoding and custom CIDtoGID map that mimics Unicode
    code page. There, however, all characters in the stream are treated as GIDs,
    including BOM, which is the reason we need to skip BOM in content text (i.e. that
    that is tied to a font).

    To signal this "special" PDFEscape / to8bitStream handling mode,
    API.text() function sets (unless you overwrite it with manual values
    given to API.text(.., flags) )
